      This is a list of top 8 sad moments from the stories, The Crucible, and The Great Gatsby, which we have read in Mr. Wright's English
      class. These stories have many sad moments that show the audience various aspects of the story. To me, the sad moments in a story are
      the most engaging moments of the story. They engage me, the reader, in the story and make a sense of connection between me and the
      characters in the story.<br><br>
      
      Without further ado, here are the top 8 saddest moments in the stories that we have read in Mr. Wright’s English class!

          Giles Corey was John Proctor's friend and a person who supported his idea. When he was being interogated by the court, he was
          refusing to answer any of the questions that they asked him. They decided to get the answer's out of him by force. They put heavy
          bolders on his body, but he still never gave them the answers. This did not stop them, they put more weights on him until he died.

          While this moment was is not sad like the others, it makes you cry out of happiness for Gatsby and Daisy. It had been 5 years
          since they had last met and they were finally getting to together again! Gatsby had big plans for him and Daisy. He would show
          Daisy how he had changed over the 5 years from just a regular man to one of the most richest people in New York.

      <h1>5. Jordan tells Nick about Tom's Affairs</h1>
      <div class="item-content img-right">
        <p>
          While Nick was at Tom's house in chapter one, he notices that Tom is getting many phone calls. That's when Jordan tells Nick that 
          Tom is having an affair with someone else. Later, we also hear that he was not present while Daisy was giving birth to her child.
          Daisy is very upset about this, but she say this to Tom. Tom is also noticeably very racist and talks about how white people are
          the superior race while eating dinner with Nick.

        <p>
          This was the moment in the story where everything starts to fall apart. Daisy and Gatsby confront Tom about the affair between
          them. After they tell him, he doesn't seem to be very upset, instead he starts to tell everyone what kind of man Gatsby truely is.
          While Tom was saying this, Daisy is starting to get very confused and starts to think if she should have had an affair with Gatsby
          in the first place.

      <h1>3. The Death Of Myrtle</h1>
      <div class="item-content img-right">
        <p>
          After the confrontation, Daisy wanted to drive back home to let her emotions out. She was driving very fast and recklessly. While
          she was driving, Myrtle jumps out on the road infront of Daisy's car and Murtle dies. After this, the tensions between Gatsby and
          Daisy increases even more. When Tom find out what happens he seems to be very sad. It is implied in the story that Tom was having
          an affair with Myrtle.

          John was accused of witchcraft by Mary Warren. She was making it up because she wanted to protect herself from Abigail. She
          knew that if she lied, she would be protected just like Abigail and the others. After sometime, John Proctor was sentenced to
          execution. He was executed along with 2 other women who were accused of being witches in front of the whole village.

          After Murtle died, her husband was very sad and depressed. That sadness and depression eventually turned into anger when he found
          out that Gatsby was the person who was driving the car, even though Gatsby was not the one driving. So one day he took his gun,
          and went to Gatsby's house. While Gatsby was in his pool, he got shot and passed away. After that, Murtle's husband points the gun
          towards himself, and shoots a second time.
