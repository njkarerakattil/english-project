      This is a list of top 8 sad moments from the stories, The Crucible, and The Great Gatsby, which we have read in Mr. Wright's English
      class. These stories have many sad moments that show the audience various aspects of the story. To me, the sad moments in a story are
      the most engaging moments of the story. They engage me, the reader, in the story and make a sense of connection between me and the
      characters in the story.<br><br>
      
      Without further ado, here are the top 8 saddest moments in the stories that we have read in Mr. Wright’s English class!

          Giles Corey was John Proctor's friend and a person who supported his idea. When he was being interogated by the court, he was
          refusing to answer any of the questions that they asked him. They decided to get the answer's out of him by force. They put heavy
          bolders on his body, but he still never gave them the answers. This did not stop them, they put more weights on him until he died.
